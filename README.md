# Scam-X
The internet is filled with scam websites that aim to steal personal information, financial data, and login credentials. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify URLs as either legitimate or scam/phishing using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, URL analysis, and metadata extraction.
